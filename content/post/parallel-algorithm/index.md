# Overview

deadlock memory leak

# Computation Models
## Sequentially, Random Access Machine Model
- Unbounded memory and you can access any location with its address.
- Every operation costs unit time.

## The PRAM(Parallel RAM)
- p processors share the memory
- Common Setting
 - EREW
 - CREW
 - ERCW
 - CRCW

 ## Work-depth model
 without knowing how many processors can be used.
 at least 2 processors. 1 is meaningless.
