## Overview

1. The Hugo Blox website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more

## NISQ
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing is a term coined by John Preskill in 2018 which noted that current quantum computers at the time (and indeed still in 2023) are prone to considerable error rates and limited in size by the number of logical qubits (or even physical qubits) in the system.[The Quantum Insider](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/03/13/what-is-nisq-quantum-computing/)
